  "description": "This corpus is a collection of english and tamil parallel text extracted 3 sources.\nAll the three were merged into a single file and cleaned.The various data cleaning steps were\na)Removed duplicates lines\nb)Removed lines containing html tags\nc) Removed empty lines and lines which contains an empty english or tamil translation\nd) Manually inspected and removed junk characters\nThere are total of 370,000 (roughly) lines of text which were split to train, validation and test sets. \nScript used for data cleaning :- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AViiS_4-ClngwZ4bKYbmlq3cVAnNHCk0#scrollTo=MWn-AuohbfXI\n\nNote:-\nFor dataset-3, the data was created by non-expert translators hired over Mechanical Turk and the other \ndatasets were created from extracting text from movie subtitles, Bible, Quran, cinema and news websites so the quality of translations are of mixed.\nHowever, it should be useful enough to get you started training models.\n\nReference for dataset 1 :- http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~ramasamy/parallel/html/\nReference for dataset 2 :- http://opus.nlpl.eu/\nReference for dataset 3 :- https://github.com/joshua-decoder/indian-parallel-corpora\n",
